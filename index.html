            <img src="assets/metroeyes-analytics.jpg" alt="MetroEyes Analytics Thumbnail">
            <p>MetroEyes Analytics is a data analysis project conducted during my time at Octave Incorporations, in collaboration with MetroEyes Clinic. The project focused on analyzing business and client data to identify key trends, such as predominant clientele groups and service utilization patterns.</p>
            <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                <li>Power BI</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Challenges:</h4>
            <p>As a newcomer to data analytics, I had to quickly adapt to tools like Power BI while ensuring the dashboards provided meaningful insights. Designing multiple dashboards required creativity in structuring the data and presenting insights in a clear and impactful manner, both in visual reports and PowerPoint presentations.</p>

            <h4>Challenges:</h4>
            <p>The primary challenge was the lack of a backend implementation, which limited the functionality of the platform. Without a backend, features like secure movie downloads and user authentication could not be implemented. This highlighted the importance of learning backend technologies to create a fully functional web application.</p>

            <img src="assets/hmds.jpg" alt="Heuristic Malware Detection System Thumbnail">
            <p>Heuristic Malware Detection System (HMDS) is a research-based project I completed as my final year thesis. It focuses on identifying malicious software by applying heuristic methods—techniques that detect potential threats based on behavioral patterns rather than traditional signatures. The project builds on prior academic work, extending and adapting the methods using Python.</p>
            <h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Challenges:</h4>
            <p>This was my first deep dive into cybersecurity and heuristic analysis. The learning curve was steep—especially when working with malware behavior datasets and understanding detection logic—but it greatly improved my confidence in tackling real-world tech problems and reinforced my interest in research-based development.</p>

                <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
                <p class="excerpt">A deep dive into JavaScript basics.</p>
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for web development. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. From manipulating the DOM to handling events, JavaScript is an essential tool for modern web development.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is also widely used in backend development with environments like Node.js, making it a full-stack language. Its popularity has led to the creation of numerous frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify the development process.</p>
                    <p>One of the key strengths of JavaScript is its ability to run in the browser, enabling client-side functionality. This includes form validation, animations, and real-time updates without requiring a page reload. Additionally, JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities, such as promises and async/await, make it ideal for handling API calls and other time-consuming tasks.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, understanding JavaScript is crucial for success in the tech industry. Its ecosystem continues to grow, making it one of the most in-demand skills for developers worldwide.</p>

                <h3>Understanding APIs</h3>
                <p class="excerpt">An introduction to APIs and how they work.</p>
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are tools that allow software applications to communicate with each other. They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.</p>
                    <p>APIs are the backbone of modern software, enabling integrations between different systems. For example, APIs allow weather apps to fetch real-time weather data, payment gateways to process transactions, and social media platforms to share content across applications.</p>
                    <p>There are different types of APIs, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. REST APIs are the most commonly used, relying on HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations. GraphQL, on the other hand, allows clients to request only the data they need, making it more efficient for certain use cases.</p>
                    <p>Understanding how APIs work and how to use them effectively is a valuable skill for developers. It opens up endless possibilities for creating connected and efficient software solutions, from building mobile apps to integrating third-party services into your projects.</p>

                <h3>CSS Grid vs Flexbox</h3>
                <p class="excerpt">Comparing CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design.</p>
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in CSS. CSS Grid is ideal for creating two-dimensional layouts, allowing precise control over rows and columns. It is perfect for designing complex web page layouts with multiple sections.</p>
                    <p>Flexbox, on the other hand, excels at one-dimensional layouts, making it perfect for aligning items in a row or column. It is commonly used for navigation bars, buttons, and other linear arrangements.</p>
                    <p>While CSS Grid provides a grid-based structure, Flexbox focuses on distributing space within a container. For example, Flexbox can align items vertically or horizontally, even if their sizes vary. CSS Grid, however, is better suited for creating layouts with overlapping elements or fixed-width columns.</p>
                    <p>Combining CSS Grid and Flexbox can lead to highly flexible and responsive layouts. For instance, you can use CSS Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for aligning items within individual sections. Mastering both systems is essential for modern web design.</p>

                <h3>React Hooks Deep Dive</h3>
                <p class="excerpt">Exploring React Hooks in detail.</p>
                <div class="full-content">
                    <p>React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They simplify component logic and make it easier to reuse stateful logic across components.</p>
                    <p>Popular hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext. The useState hook allows you to manage state in functional components, while useEffect lets you handle side effects such as data fetching or DOM manipulation. The useContext hook simplifies accessing context values without needing to wrap components in a Consumer.</p>
                    <p>React also provides custom hooks, which allow developers to encapsulate reusable logic. For example, you can create a custom hook to handle form validation or fetch data from an API. This promotes code reusability and keeps components clean and focused.</p>
                    <p>Mastering hooks is essential for building efficient and maintainable React applications. They have revolutionized the way developers write React code, making it more concise and easier to understand. Hooks are now a fundamental part of React development, and learning them is a must for any aspiring React developer.</p>
